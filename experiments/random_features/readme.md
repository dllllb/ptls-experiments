# Random and arange features experiment

Random and arange features were added to rosbank dataset to test their impact on quality on the downstream task for CPC and Coles modules.

## Random features

Random features are from uniform discrete distribution (`np.random.randint`) with 100 unique values. Embeddings size for random features was 24 for Coles and 18 for CPC.

## Arange features 

There is two types of arange features: 

1. Arange features - just an arange features for every user (`np.arange(len(user_items))`)
2. Cycled arange features - `np.arange(len(user_items)) mod 100 + 1` 


# Rosbank results 

Test results for the rosbank dataset. The more random features, the larger the metric on validation ( `recall_top_k`). Also tested random features impact on quality with higher hidden size (x2 and x4).
